What is Lending Club?

Lending Club is a peer-to-peer company(P2P) headquartered in San Francisco, California. P2P lending is the practice of lending money to individuals or businesses through online services that match lenders with borrowers. For Lending Club, and most other P2P lending companies, they make money through origination and service fees.

Why choose Lending Club?

Because their services are online, this allows Lending Club to operate at a lower overhead or costs, and thus provide their services more cheaply than traditional financial institutions. This process allows for lenders to earn higher returns compared to savings and investment products offered by traditional banks, while borrowers can borrow money at lower interest rates.

Objective:

As investors, there are two ways to invest in loans. 1) As a lender or 2) Purchasing them off the secondary mortgage market (a marketplace where home loans and servicing rights are bought and sold between lenders and investors). The return on investment is therefore relative to what method was chosen. So, as a data scientist, rather than predicting return, it is more tangible to find the projected total payment percentage. Furthermore, simply predicting the probability of default does not give us the full picture. When someone defaults is just important as if someone defaults.
